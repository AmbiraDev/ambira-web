## Recommendations for Future Work

1. **Apply pattern to other pages**
   - Use same focus indicator style across entire application
   - Ensure consistency in all dropdown components

2. **Create shared component**
   - Extract dropdown logic into reusable component
   - Ensure focus styles are built-in

3. **Add automated tests**
   - Include focus indicator tests in CI/CD
   - Test contrast ratios automatically

4. **Consider focus-visible**
   - Only show focus rings for keyboard navigation
   - Hide for mouse clicks (optional enhancement)

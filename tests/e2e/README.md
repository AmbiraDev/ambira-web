## 🎯 Test Categories

### Smoke Tests (`smoke/`)

**Purpose**: Fast, critical-path tests that verify core functionality works correctly.

**Characteristics**:
- Run on every PR and push to main
- Test only the most critical user journeys
- Should complete in under 5 minutes
- Include accessibility checks
- Test on both desktop and mobile viewports

**Current Smoke Tests**:
1. **Feed Page** (`smoke/feed.spec.ts`)
   - Page loads successfully
   - Navigation elements are visible
   - No critical console errors
   - Passes accessibility audit
   - Responsive on mobile
   - Keyboard navigation works

2. **Timer Page** (`smoke/timer.spec.ts`)
   - Timer interface loads
   - Controls are functional
   - No critical console errors
   - Passes accessibility audit
   - Responsive on mobile
   - Handles authentication state

3. **Authentication** (`smoke/auth.spec.ts`)
   - Login page loads
   - Form validation works
   - No critical console errors
   - Passes accessibility audit
   - Responsive on mobile
   - Protected routes handled correctly

## 🚀 Running Tests

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Install Playwright browsers (first time only)
npx playwright install
```

### Local Development

```bash
# Run all E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run only smoke tests
npm run test:smoke

# Run tests in UI mode (interactive)
npm run test:e2e:ui

# Run tests in debug mode
npm run test:e2e:debug

# View last test report
npm run test:e2e:report
```

### Watch Mode

```bash
# Run specific test file in watch mode
npx playwright test e2e/smoke/feed.spec.ts --ui
```

### Run Specific Tests

```bash
# Run a specific test file
npx playwright test e2e/smoke/feed.spec.ts

# Run tests matching a pattern
npx playwright test --grep "accessibility"

# Run tests on specific browser
npx playwright test --project=chromium
npx playwright test --project=mobile-chrome
```

## ♿ Accessibility Testing

All smoke tests include automated accessibility checks using [axe-core](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core).

### What's Checked

- WCAG 2.0 Level A & AA compliance
- WCAG 2.1 Level A & AA compliance
- Color contrast ratios
- ARIA attributes
- Semantic HTML structure
- Keyboard navigation
- Screen reader compatibility

### Accessibility Utilities

**`runAccessibilityScan(page, options?)`**
Runs a comprehensive accessibility scan on the current page.

```typescript
import { runAccessibilityScan } from '../utils/accessibility';

const results = await runAccessibilityScan(page, {
  exclude: ['#third-party-widget'],  // Exclude specific elements
  disableRules: ['color-contrast']    // Disable specific rules
});
```

**`formatA11yViolations(violations)`**
Formats accessibility violations into readable error messages.

**`checkBasicAccessibility(page)`**
Performs basic accessibility checks:
- Page has a title
- Main landmark exists
- Heading structure is present
- Skip links are available

### Custom Test Fixture

The `test` fixture from `fixtures/test-base.ts` includes accessibility utilities:

```typescript
import { test, expect } from '../fixtures/test-base';

test('my test', async ({ page, makeAxeBuilder }) => {
  await page.goto('/');

  // Run accessibility scan
  const results = await makeAxeBuilder().analyze();
  expect(results.violations).toHaveLength(0);
});
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Playwright Config (`playwright.config.ts`)

Key configuration options:

- **Test Directory**: `./e2e`
- **Parallel Execution**: Enabled locally, disabled in CI
- **Retries**: 2 retries in CI, 0 locally
- **Base URL**: `http://localhost:3000` (configurable via `PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL`)
- **Browsers**: Chromium (desktop + mobile)

### Projects

- **chromium**: Desktop Chrome at 1440x900
- **mobile-chrome**: Pixel 5 viewport

### CI Configuration

In CI, Playwright:
- Runs only Chromium tests (for speed)
- Produces HTML and JUnit reports
- Captures screenshots/videos on failure
- Uploads artifacts for debugging

## 📊 Test Reports

### HTML Report

After running tests, view the interactive HTML report:

```bash
npm run test:e2e:report
```

The report includes:
- Test results and statistics
- Screenshots and videos of failures
- Trace viewer for debugging
- Accessibility violation details

### CI Reports

In CI, test reports are uploaded as artifacts and available in the GitHub Actions run.

## 🎨 Best Practices

### 1. Test User Behavior, Not Implementation

```typescript
// Good ✅
await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Start Timer' }).click();

// Avoid ❌
await page.locator('.timer-button-class').click();
```

### 2. Use Playwright's Auto-Waiting

Playwright automatically waits for elements to be actionable:

```typescript
// Playwright automatically waits for element to be visible and enabled
await page.getByRole('button').click();
```

### 3. Test Accessibility in Every Test

```typescript
test('feature works correctly', async ({ page, makeAxeBuilder }) => {
  // ... test logic ...

  // Always check accessibility
  const results = await makeAxeBuilder().analyze();
  expect(results.violations).toHaveLength(0);
});
```

### 4. Test Responsive Design

```typescript
test('mobile viewport', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.setViewportSize({ width: 375, height: 667 });

  // Verify no horizontal scroll
  const hasHorizontalScroll = await page.evaluate(() => {
    return document.documentElement.scrollWidth > document.documentElement.clientWidth;
  });
  expect(hasHorizontalScroll).toBe(false);
});
```

### 5. Handle Authentication State

For authenticated tests, use Playwright's [authentication state](https://playwright.dev/docs/auth):

```typescript
// Future enhancement: Store auth state
test.use({ storageState: 'auth.json' });
```

### 6. Keep Smoke Tests Fast

Smoke tests should:
- Test only critical paths
- Avoid unnecessary waits
- Run in under 5 minutes total
- Fail fast on errors

### 7. Use Descriptive Test Names

```typescript
// Good ✅
test('should display error message when submitting invalid email');

// Avoid ❌
test('email validation');
```

## 🐛 Debugging Tests

### Debug Mode

Run tests in debug mode to step through them:

```bash
npm run test:e2e:debug
```

### Playwright Inspector

The inspector shows:
- Current page state
- Selector picker
- Step-by-step execution
- Network activity

### Trace Viewer

View traces of failed tests:

```bash
npx playwright show-trace trace.zip
```

### Screenshots and Videos

Failed tests automatically capture:
- Screenshots on failure
- Videos of the entire test run (when enabled)

## 📝 Writing New Tests

### 1. Choose the Right Test Type

- **Smoke Tests**: Critical user paths that must always work
- **Feature Tests**: Comprehensive testing of specific features
- **Visual Tests**: Screenshot comparison tests (future)

### 2. Create Test File

```bash
# Create new smoke test
touch e2e/smoke/my-feature.spec.ts
```

### 3. Use the Template

```typescript
import { test, expect } from '../fixtures/test-base';
import { formatA11yViolations } from '../utils/accessibility';

test.describe('My Feature - Smoke Tests', () => {
  test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {
    await page.goto('/my-feature');
  });

  test('should load successfully', async ({ page }) => {
    await page.waitForLoadState('networkidle');
    const title = await page.title();
    expect(title).toBeTruthy();
  });

  test('should pass accessibility audit', async ({ page, makeAxeBuilder }) => {
    await page.waitForLoadState('networkidle');
    const results = await makeAxeBuilder().analyze();

    if (results.violations.length > 0) {
      console.log(formatA11yViolations(results.violations));
    }

    expect(results.violations).toHaveLength(0);
  });
});
```

### 4. Run and Verify

```bash
# Run your new test
npx playwright test e2e/smoke/my-feature.spec.ts --ui
```

## 🔄 CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions Workflows

**Main CI Workflow** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
- Runs on every PR and push to main
- Executes smoke tests in parallel with other checks
- Builds app, starts server, runs tests
- Uploads reports on failure

**Standalone Playwright Workflow** (`.github/workflows/playwright.yml`)
- Can be triggered manually
- More detailed reporting
- Posts results as PR comments

### Required Environment Variables

For CI, set these secrets in GitHub:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID
```

Optional:
```
PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL  # Override base URL for tests
```

### CI Performance Optimizations

1. **Browser Caching**: Playwright browsers are cached between runs
2. **Parallel Execution**: Tests run in parallel (except in CI for stability)
3. **Smart Retries**: Failed tests retry up to 2 times in CI
4. **Minimal Browsers**: Only Chromium runs in CI by default

   - Identify and fix critical UX issues
   - Test on both desktop and mobile (especially mobile for study segment)
   - Load test: What happens with 1000 concurrent users? (Should be fine on Firebase)

2. **Onboarding Optimization (2 days)**
   - Simplify signup (email/password, or Google Auth)

---

## Critical Success Factors

### 1. Founder Involvement is Essential

- You must be doing outreach (not hiring for it yet)
- You must be responsive to user feedback
- You must be sleeping on Discord, Reddit, Twitter (where your users are)

### 2. Iterate on Retention, Not Growth

- Getting 15K users is easy; keeping them is hard
- Focus ruthlessly on D30 retention >30% before scaling
- Every feature should have one goal: Improve retention

### 3. Pick Your Beachhead Early

- Don't try to be "Strava for everything" from day 1
- Focus on study/academic segment (lowest friction, highest engagement)
- Expand to founders, professionals only after validating first segment

### 4. Measure Everything

- Track retention by cohort (which source is best?)
- Track engagement by feature (which drives stickiness?)
- Track viral coefficient (are users inviting friends?)
- Use data to make every decision

### 5. Listen, Don't Guess

- User feedback matters more than your intuition
- "Users are asking for X" is better signal than "I think X is cool"
- Let the data tell you what to build next

---

## Key Metrics Dashboard

Track these daily/weekly:

```
GROWTH
- New signups (daily)
- Cumulative users
- Growth rate (% week-over-week)

RETENTION
- D1 retention (% of cohort coming back day 2)
- D7 retention (% of cohort coming back day 7)
- D30 retention (% of cohort coming back day 30)

ENGAGEMENT
- Sessions per user (daily average)
- Session duration (average minutes)
- Features used (% of users kudoing, commenting, etc.)

VIRALITY
- Invites sent (daily)
- Invites accepted
- Viral coefficient (how many friends each user brings)

MONETIZATION
- Groups with paid tier enabled
- Revenue per group
- Total monthly revenue
- Group member payment rate

PMF SIGNALS
- NPS (how likely to recommend? target: 40+)
- Feature requests (are they asking for things or leaving?)
- Testimonials (unprompted praise?)
```

---

## Contingency Plans

### If Retention is Low (<25% D30)

- **Action**: Stop scaling, focus on improving product
- **Investigate**:
  - Why are users leaving? (Conduct exit interviews)
  - What features drive retention? (Focus on these)
  - Wrong segment? (Try different cohort)
- **Timeline**: Spend 2-3 weeks iterating, then reassess

### If No Segment Shows Traction

- **Action**: Pick single segment, go deep
- **Decision**: Focus on whichever segment has:
  - Best retention
  - Highest NPS
  - Strongest feature requests
- **Timeline**: Pick by week 8, commit through month 3

### If Creators Won't Promote

- **Action**: Don't force partnerships
- **Pivot**: Focus on organic communities (Reddit, Discord)
- **Alternative**: Build reach through content (blog, YouTube)
- **Timeline**: Reassess by week 6

### If Product Hunt Flops

- **Action**: Don't panic; PH is just one day
- **Focus**: Long-term retention, not ranking
- **Learn**: What did PH feedback reveal?
- **Next**: Apply feedback, iterate

---

## Success Looks Like (Day 90)

You'll know you have PMF when:

1. **Retention**: D30 retention is 35%+ (sustain without acquisition)
2. **Virality**: Users are naturally inviting friends (viral coefficient >1.0)
3. **Engagement**: Users opening app 5+ times per week
4. **Monetization**: 10-20 groups generating revenue
5. **Feedback**: Users asking "When will you add X?" (not "Why should I use this?")
6. **NPS**: 40+ (would recommend without prompting)
7. **Segments**: 1-2 segments showing strong PMF (academic, founders, professionals)

If you hit these metrics, you're ready to:

- Raise seed funding (if needed)
- Hire team (if needed)
- Scale to adjacent segments
- Build enterprise/B2B partnerships

---

## Budget Estimate (90 Days)

**Minimal/Bootstrap**:

- Server costs: $500-1K
- Domain/hosting: $100
- Design/assets: $0 (founder-led)
- Sponsorships: $0-2K (optional, for creators)
- **Total**: $500-3K

**If raising small round**:

- Add: $5-10K for creator partnerships
- Add: $2-5K for content creation (blog, video)
- Add: $1K for paid ads (very limited)
- **Total**: $8-20K

**Principle**: Avoid spending on ads/sponsorships until you understand unit economics. Earned media (creators, communities, organic) is 10x better for early validation.

```

## Final Note to Founder

This 90-day plan is a guide, not gospel. Your job is to:

1. **Move fast**: Make decisions quickly, iterate often
2. **Listen hard**: User feedback beats your intuition
3. **Measure everything**: Data guides all decisions
4. **Stay focused**: Don't chase every opportunity
5. **Be authentic**: Build for the community, not hype

If you execute this plan with discipline, you'll have either:

- **Success Signal**: Clear PMF in 1-2 segments, ready to scale
- **Learning Data**: Clear understanding of what works/doesn't work

Either way, you'll be in a much better position to decide next steps.

Good luck. You've built something special. Now go prove it to the world.

# Profile Privacy & Viewing Implementation

## Overview
Implemented comprehensive profile privacy controls and the ability to view other users' profiles while respecting their privacy settings.

## Features Implemented

### 1. View Other Users' Profiles ‚úÖ

**Route:** `/profile/[username]`

Users can now view any other user's profile by navigating to:
- `http://localhost:3001/profile/johnj1`
- `http://localhost:3001/profile/alice`
- etc.

The profile page automatically:
- Detects if it's your own profile (`isOwnProfile` check)
- Shows/hides appropriate buttons based on ownership
- Respects privacy settings

### 2. Privacy Settings Controls ‚úÖ

**Location:** Settings ‚Üí Privacy (`/settings/privacy`)

**Three Privacy Levels:**

#### Profile Visibility
- **Everyone:** Anyone can view your profile
- **Followers Only:** Only people you follow back can view
- **Private:** Only you can view your profile

#### Activity Visibility  
- **Everyone:** Your sessions and activity are public
- **Followers Only:** Only followers can see your activity
- **Private:** Your activity is completely private

#### Project Visibility
- **Everyone:** Your projects are public
- **Followers Only:** Only followers can see projects
- **Private:** Your projects are completely private

### 3. Privacy Enforcement ‚úÖ

**Firebase API (`getUserProfile`):**

```typescript
// Privacy checks in order:
1. Check if profile is private ‚Üí deny if not owner
2. Check if current user is following
3. Check if followers-only ‚Üí deny if not following
4. Grant access if checks pass
```

**Error Messages:**
- `"User not found"` - Username doesn't exist
- `"This profile is private"` - Profile set to private
- `"This profile is only visible to followers"` - Followers-only and you're not following

### 4. UI/UX Features ‚úÖ

#### For Your Own Profile:
- ‚úÖ "Edit Profile" button (links to Settings)
- ‚úÖ "Logout" button in profile info
- ‚úÖ All stats and content visible
- ‚úÖ Full access to all tabs

#### For Other Users' Profiles:
- ‚úÖ "Follow" / "Following" button
- ‚ùå No edit buttons
- ‚ùå No logout button
- ‚úÖ Can view public content only
- ‚úÖ Respects privacy settings

#### Error States:
- üîí **Private Profile:** Shows lock icon with message
- üë• **Followers Only:** Shows followers icon with message
- ‚ùå **User Not Found:** Shows user-x icon with message

### 5. Profile Header Enhancements ‚úÖ

**Dynamic Button Display:**

```typescript
// Only show edit button for own profile
{isOwnProfile && showEditButton && onEditClick && (
  <Button onClick={onEditClick}>
    <Edit3 /> Edit Profile
  </Button>
)}

// Only show follow button for other users
{canFollow && (
  <Button onClick={handleFollow}>
    <UserPlus /> Follow
  </Button>
)}
```

**Logout Button:**
- Only visible on your own profile
- Located in profile info section
- Red color for clear indication

## Technical Implementation

### Database Structure

**Users Collection:**
```typescript
{
  username: string,
  name: string,
  profileVisibility: 'everyone' | 'followers' | 'private',
  activityVisibility: 'everyone' | 'followers' | 'private',
  projectVisibility: 'everyone' | 'followers' | 'private',
  blockedUsers: string[],
  // ... other fields
}
```

### Privacy Check Flow

```
1. User navigates to /profile/[username]
     ‚Üì
2. loadProfile() fetches user data
     ‚Üì
3. getUserProfile() checks privacy:
   - Is it own profile? ‚Üí Grant access
   - Is profile private? ‚Üí Deny access
   - Is profile followers-only?
     - Are they following? ‚Üí Grant access
     - Not following? ‚Üí Deny access
   - Profile is public ‚Üí Grant access
     ‚Üì
4. Display profile or error message
```

4. **`/components/PrivacySettings.tsx`**

## User Flows

### Flow 1: Viewing Public Profile
```
1. User A visits /profile/userB
2. userB has profileVisibility = 'everyone'
3. ‚úÖ Profile loads successfully
4. User A sees "Follow" button
5. User A can view all public content
```

### Flow 2: Viewing Private Profile
```
1. User A visits /profile/userB
2. userB has profileVisibility = 'private'
3. ‚ùå Access denied
4. Shows: "Private Profile - @userB's profile is private"
5. "Go Home" button to navigate away
```

### Flow 3: Viewing Followers-Only Profile
```
1. User A visits /profile/userB
2. userB has profileVisibility = 'followers'
3. Check: Is User A following userB?
   - Yes ‚Üí ‚úÖ Profile loads
   - No ‚Üí ‚ùå Shows "Followers Only" message
```

### Flow 4: Viewing Own Profile
```
1. User A visits /profile/userA
2. isOwnProfile = true
3. ‚úÖ Full access granted
4. Shows "Edit Profile" button
5. Shows "Logout" button

## Privacy Settings UI

**Location:** `/settings/privacy`

**Features:**
- üé® Clean card-based design
- üîÑ Real-time save
- üìä Visual indicators (icons for each privacy level)
- üìù Helpful descriptions
- üö´ Blocked users management

**Privacy Icons:**
- üåç Globe = Everyone
- üë• Users = Followers Only
- üîí Lock = Private

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Can view other users' public profiles
- [x] Can follow/unfollow from profile page
- [x] Cannot see edit button on other users' profiles
- [x] Can see edit button on own profile
- [x] Private profiles block access correctly
- [x] Followers-only profiles check following status
- [x] Error messages display correctly
- [x] Privacy settings save properly
- [x] Profile visibility respects settings
- [x] Logout button only on own profile

## Security Considerations

1. **Server-Side Validation:** Privacy checks in Firebase API
2. **Follow Verification:** Checks actual following relationship
3. **Owner Verification:** Compares authenticated user ID
4. **Error Handling:** Doesn't reveal if user exists when private
5. **Access Control:** No client-side bypasses

## Known Limitations

1. **Blocked Users:** UI is ready but needs backend integration
2. **Mutual Follows:** Currently checks one-way following only
3. **Activity Feed:** Privacy for posts not yet fully integrated

## Future Enhancements

1. **Mutual Follow Detection:** Show "Mutual" badge
2. **Block User:** Implement block functionality from profile
3. **Report User:** Add reporting capability
4. **Share Profile:** Add share button
5. **Profile Analytics:** Show profile views (own profile only)

## Code Examples

### Checking Privacy in Component
```typescript
const isOwnProfile = currentUser?.username === username;

if (!isOwnProfile && profile.isPrivate) {
  // Show private profile message
}
```

### Conditional Rendering
```typescript
{isOwnProfile && (
  <Button onClick={() => router.push('/settings')}>
    Edit Profile
  </Button>
)}

{!isOwnProfile && (
  <Button onClick={handleFollow}>
    {isFollowing ? 'Following' : 'Follow'}
  </Button>
)}
```

# Image Upload Feature - Comprehensive Test Suite

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive test suite for the image upload feature in Ambira. The feature allows users to attach up to 3 images to their work sessions, with images displayed in a swipeable gallery on both mobile and web.

## Test Files Created

### 1. **Image Upload Utilities Tests**
**File:** `src/lib/__tests__/imageUpload.test.ts`

- ✅ User authentication checks
- ✅ Image deletion
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ Compression bypass (returns original file)

**Key Test Cases:**
```typescript
- should upload a valid image file

- should render ImageGallery between description and stats
- should handle maximum 3 images
- should work with all session interactions when images present
- should render correctly when description is expanded
```

### 4. **Integration Tests**
**File:** `src/__tests__/integration/image-upload-flow-simple.test.ts`
**Tests:** 13 passing
**Coverage:**
- ✅ Complete upload workflow
- ✅ Validation logic

## Mocking Strategy

### Firebase Mocks
```typescript
jest.mock('@/lib/firebase', () => ({
  auth: { currentUser: { uid: 'test-user' } },
  db: {},
  storage: {}
}));

jest.mock('firebase/storage', () => ({
  ref: jest.fn(),
  uploadBytes: jest.fn(),
  getDownloadURL: jest.fn(),
  deleteObject: jest.fn()
}));
```

### Component Mocks
```typescript
// Next.js Image
jest.mock('next/image', () => ({
  __esModule: true,
  default: (props: any) => <img {...props} />
}));

// Next.js Link
jest.mock('next/link', () => ({
  __esModule: true,
  default: ({ children, href }: any) => <a href={href}>{children}</a>
}));
```

## Validation Rules Tested

1. **File Type**: Must be image/* mime type
2. **File Size**: Maximum 5MB per image
3. **Image Count**: Maximum 3 images per session
4. **Authentication**: User must be logged in
5. **URL Format**: Must be valid Firebase Storage URL or blob URL

## Future Test Enhancements

### Potential Additions
- [ ] E2E tests with Playwright/Cypress
- [ ] Visual regression testing
- [ ] Performance testing for large images
- [ ] Accessibility testing with axe
- [ ] Browser compatibility testing
- [ ] Mobile device testing
- [ ] Network condition testing (slow 3G, offline)

### Advanced Scenarios
- [ ] Image rotation/orientation
- [ ] Image compression effectiveness
- [ ] Concurrent upload handling
- [ ] Resume failed uploads
- [ ] Image caching
- [ ] CDN integration testing

## Maintenance Notes

- All tests are isolated and can run independently
- Mocks are properly cleaned up between tests
- Console errors are suppressed in tests
- Tests follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- All async operations use proper await/waitFor
- Test names are descriptive and follow convention

## Firebase Integration Details

### Firebase Storage

**Upload Flow:**
1. Authenticate user
2. Generate unique filename (`{timestamp}_{random}.{ext}`)
3. Create storage ref: `session-images/{userId}/{filename}`
4. Upload file bytes
5. Get download URL
6. Return `{ url, path }`

**Storage URL Format:**
```
https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/{project}.appspot.com/o/session-images%2F{userId}%2F{filename}?alt=media&token={token}
```

**Security:**
- User-scoped paths: `/session-images/{userId}/`
- Only authenticated users can upload
- 5MB file size limit enforced
- Image type validation

### Firestore Structure

**Session Document with Images:**
```typescript
{
  userId: string,
  projectId: string,
  title: string,
  description: string,
  duration: number,
  startTime: Timestamp,
  images: string[], // Array of Firebase Storage URLs
  tags: string[],
  visibility: 'everyone' | 'followers' | 'private',
  supportCount: number,
  commentCount: number,
  createdAt: Timestamp,
  updatedAt: Timestamp
}
```

**Images Field:**
- Type: `string[]` (array of Firebase Storage URLs)
- Max length: 3
- Default: `[]` (empty array)
- Optional: Yes (backward compatible)

### Firebase Mocking Strategy

**jest.setup.js includes:**
```javascript
global.Response = class Response { ... }
global.Request = class Request { ... }
global.Headers = class Headers { ... }
```

**Test Mocks:**
```typescript
jest.mock('firebase/storage', () => ({
  ref: jest.fn(),
  uploadBytes: jest.fn(),
  getDownloadURL: jest.fn(),
  deleteObject: jest.fn()
}));

jest.mock('firebase/firestore', () => ({
  doc: jest.fn(),
  getDoc: jest.fn(),
  getDocs: jest.fn(),
  addDoc: jest.fn(),
  setDoc: jest.fn(),
  updateDoc: jest.fn(),
  query: jest.fn(),
  where: jest.fn(),
  orderBy: jest.fn(),
  limit: jest.fn(),
  collection: jest.fn(),
  serverTimestamp: jest.fn(() => new Date()),
  Timestamp: { fromDate: (d: Date) => d }
}));
```

## Running Tests

### All Image Tests (including Firebase)
```bash
npm test -- imageUpload.test ImageGallery.test SessionCard-images.test image-upload-flow-simple.test firebase-image-storage.test session-images-firestore.test --no-coverage
```

### Firebase Integration Only
```bash
npm test -- firebase-image-storage.test session-images-firestore.test --no-coverage
```

### Individual Suites
```bash
# Firebase Storage integration
npm test -- firebase-image-storage.test --no-coverage

# Firestore data structure
npm test -- session-images-firestore.test --no-coverage
```

## Key Scenarios Tested

### 1. Complete Upload Flow
```typescript
User selects images
  → Validate (type, size, count)
  → Upload to Firebase Storage
  → Get download URLs
  → Save URLs to Firestore session
  → Display in feed
  → Load from Firestore
  → Render in ImageGallery
```

### 2. Firebase Storage Operations
```typescript
File → Firebase Storage → Download URL
  ✓ User authentication checked
  ✓ File stored in user-scoped path
  ✓ Unique filename generated
  ✓ Download URL returned
  ✓ URL contains token
```

### 3. Firestore Data Flow
```typescript
Session Creation:
  images: [] → Firestore document

Session Retrieval:
  Firestore document → session.images → ImageGallery

Feed Display:
  Query sessions → Filter by visibility → Populate details → Render with images
```

### 4. Error Handling
```typescript
✓ Storage quota exceeded
✓ Network errors
✓ Invalid file type
✓ File too large
✓ Too many images
✓ Unauthenticated user
✓ Corrupt data
✓ Missing fields
```

## Validation Rules (Firebase-Enforced)

### Storage Rules Tested
```
- Must be authenticated
- Path must be /session-images/{userId}/
- File size ≤ 5MB
- File type must start with image/
```

### Firestore Rules Tested
```
- images field is optional
- images is array of strings
- Maximum 3 URLs
- URLs must be Firebase Storage URLs
```

## Performance Considerations

### Tested Performance Aspects
- ✅ Parallel image uploads (3 images)
- ✅ Unique filename generation (no collisions)
- ✅ Large feed with images (100+ sessions)
- ✅ Efficient query loading
- ✅ Image order preservation

### Benchmark Results
- Upload 3 images in parallel: < 100ms (mocked)
- Load 20 sessions with images: < 5000ms (mocked)
- Generate unique filenames: < 1ms each

## Security Testing

### Authentication
```typescript
✓ Upload requires auth.currentUser
✓ Delete requires auth.currentUser
✓ Null user throws error
```

### Path Security
```typescript
✓ Images stored in /session-images/{userId}/
✓ User ID matches authenticated user
✓ No path traversal possible
```

### URL Validation
```typescript
✓ Only Firebase Storage URLs accepted
✓ Must contain token
✓ Must be HTTPS
✓ Rejects blob:, data:, http: URLs
```

## Backward Compatibility

### Legacy Sessions
```typescript
✓ Sessions without images field display correctly
✓ Undefined images treated as []
✓ No migration required
✓ Feed works with mixed sessions (with/without images)
```

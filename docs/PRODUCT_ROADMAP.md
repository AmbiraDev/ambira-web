5. **Limited error handling** - Silent failures frustrate users
6. **No help system** - Users get stuck without guidance

## 🎓 Lessons & Principles

### Build for Retention, Not Acquisition

- First 100 users are about learning, not scaling
- Focus on making existing users love the product
- Quality > Quantity at this stage

### Measure Everything

- Instrument analytics from day 1
- Track both quantitative (metrics) and qualitative (interviews)
- Make data-driven decisions

### Ship Fast, Iterate Faster

- 8 weeks is aggressive - cut scope if needed
- Better to launch with 80% of features than wait for 100%
- Real users will tell you what's actually important

### Prioritize Ruthlessly

- P0 = Can't launch without it
- P1 = Users will churn without it
- P2 = Nice to have for quality
- P3 = Post-launch backlog

---

## 📝 Notes

- This roadmap assumes a team of 1-2 developers
- Adjust timeline based on actual velocity after Week 1
- Re-prioritize based on beta user feedback in Weeks 5-6
- Keep feature branches small and merge frequently
- Deploy to staging after each feature for testing

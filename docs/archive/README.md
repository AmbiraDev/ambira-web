# Documentation Archive

This directory contains historical documentation, completed migration reports, and archived implementation details. These documents are preserved for reference but represent completed work.

## Purpose

The archive serves to:

1. **Preserve Historical Context** - Keep records of major architectural decisions and migrations
2. **Maintain Audit Trail** - Document the evolution of the codebase over time
3. **Reference Past Solutions** - Learn from previous implementations and patterns
4. **Keep Root Clean** - Move completed/historical docs out of active documentation areas

## Archive Organization

### `/migrations/`

Completed migration reports and architectural transition documentation.

**Files:**

- `CONTEXT_ELIMINATION_STRATEGY.md` - Strategy for eliminating global context providers
- `CONTEXT_ELIMINATION_SUMMARY.md` - Executive summary of context elimination work
- `CONTEXT_ELIMINATION_DIAGRAMS.md` - Visual diagrams of the migration process
- `MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` - Step-by-step guide for migrating to React Query patterns
- `MIGRATION_STATUS.md` - Final status report of React Query migration (100% complete)
- `SUMMARY.md` - Implementation summary of React Query at feature boundaries

**What's Here:**

- Context to React Query migration (completed)
- Architectural pattern transitions
- Caching strategy implementation history

### `/phases/`

Phase-based implementation reports (currently empty, ready for future phase documentation).

**What Belongs Here:**

- Phase 2 implementation reports
- Phase 3 planning and completion docs
- Multi-phase refactoring summaries

### `/discussions/`

Team discussions and strategy documents (currently empty, ready for archived strategy docs).

**What Belongs Here:**

- Product strategy discussions (PMF, first 100 users, etc.)
- Marketing strategy documents
- Team decision-making records

### `/reports/`

General completion reports and improvement summaries.

**Files:**

- `ESLINT_TEST_IMPROVEMENTS.md` - Report on ESLint test file configuration and fixes

**What Belongs Here:**

- Tool configuration improvement reports
- Code quality initiative summaries
- Test infrastructure enhancement reports
- Security improvement documents

## Finding Information

### Looking for current architecture?

See [/docs/architecture/](../architecture/README.md) for active architectural documentation.

### Looking for testing setup?

See [/docs/testing/](../testing/README.md) for current testing guides.

### Looking for migration patterns?

Check `/migrations/` for historical context, but refer to current architecture docs for latest patterns.

## Contributing to Archive

When archiving documentation:

1. **Only archive completed work** - Active migrations/work stay in main docs
2. **Update index.md** - Add references to archived docs in [/docs/index.md](../index.md)
3. **Preserve links** - Update any broken internal links after moving files
4. **Add context** - Brief note in archive README about what was archived and when

## Archive vs Active Documentation

| Type                 | Location                     | Purpose                          |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Current architecture | `/docs/architecture/`        | Active patterns and guidelines   |
| Current testing      | `/docs/testing/`             | Active test setup and standards  |
| Completed migrations | `/docs/archive/migrations/`  | Historical migration records     |
| Completed reports    | `/docs/archive/reports/`     | Tool/process improvement history |
| Phase reports        | `/docs/archive/phases/`      | Multi-phase project summaries    |
| Strategy discussions | `/docs/archive/discussions/` | Team decision records            |

## When to Archive

Archive documentation when:

- Migration is 100% complete
- Pattern is fully adopted across codebase
- Report documents a completed initiative
- Document is no longer actively referenced for current work
- Information is historical/reference-only

Keep documentation active when:

- Work is in progress
- Pattern is still being adopted
- Document is actively used for development
- Information guides current implementation decisions

## Questions?

For questions about archived documentation or to understand historical context:

1. Read the archived document for context
2. Check commit history for when it was archived
3. Refer to current docs for latest patterns
4. Ask team members familiar with the migration

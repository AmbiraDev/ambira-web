## Testing Best Practices

1. **Test incrementally** - Complete one feature area before moving to the next
2. **Document as you go** - Record issues immediately when found
3. **Take screenshots** - Visual evidence helps developers understand issues
4. **Test edge cases** - Don't just test the happy path
5. **Consider user personas** - Test from different user perspectives (new user, power user, admin)
6. **Test data states** - Empty states, loading states, error states, full states
7. **Think like a user** - Would a real user encounter this issue?
8. **Be specific** - Vague bug reports are hard to fix
9. **Verify fixes** - Retest after issues are resolved
10. **Test integrations** - Ensure features work together, not just in isolation

---

---

## Automation Considerations

After manual testing, consider which tests could be automated:

- **Unit tests** - Individual function and component testing
- **Integration tests** - Feature interaction testing
- **E2E tests** - Critical user flow testing (login, create session, etc.)
- **Visual regression tests** - UI consistency testing
- **Performance tests** - Load time and rendering performance
- **Accessibility tests** - Automated a11y scanning

## Key Strategic Insights

### What Makes This Different from Simple Time Tracking

- **Accountability features** - Commitments, pledges, buddy system
- **Goal-oriented** - Not just logging hours, but working toward something
- **Social but not performative** - "We're in this together" not "look at me"
- **Quality over quantity** - Streaks and consistency matter more than hours

### Metrics That Matter

- **Primary:** % toward active goals
- **Secondary:** Study streak (days)
- **Tertiary:** Milestones earned (meaningful badges)
- **De-emphasized:** Total hours (show but don't highlight)

### Psychology to Leverage

- **Social facilitation** - People work harder when others are watching
- **Commitment device** - Public pledges increase follow-through
- **Progress tracking** - Visible progress is motivating
- **Streak maintenance** - Loss aversion keeps people coming back
- **Shared struggle** - Community around common challenges reduces performance anxiety

## Design Philosophy

Ambira is inspired by Strava's social fitness tracking model but applied to productivity. The design emphasizes:

- **Social Accountability** - Connect with friends and see their progress
- **Gamification** - Streaks, achievements, and challenges
- **Clean Interface** - Focus on content with minimal distractions
- **Mobile-First** - Responsive design that works on all devices
- **Electric Blue Theme** - Energetic and modern color palette

## Next Steps

The social foundation is now complete! Key areas for further development include:

1. **Backend API Integration** - Connect to real backend services
2. **Real-time Features** - Live updates for following and activity
3. **Groups & Challenges** - Community features and competitions
4. **Analytics & Insights** - Advanced progress tracking and recommendations
5. **Mobile App** - Native iOS/Android applications
6. **Achievement System** - Badges and milestones for user engagement

## Development Notes

- Firestore does not allow fields with `undefined` values. Creation and update logic for projects now strips undefined keys before writes to prevent `Unsupported field value: undefined` errors.
- **Follow/Unfollow System**: Uses batched `update()` operations instead of `set()` with merge for better compatibility with Firestore security rules and increment operations. Security rules allow authenticated users to update follower/following counts without modifying other profile fields.
- **Sessions-Only Architecture (Strava-like)**:
  - **Sessions ARE the primary content type** - Following Strava's model where activities are the main content, sessions function as posts directly. There is NO separate Post type or posts collection.
  - The feed displays sessions with `visibility: 'everyone' | 'followers'`, similar to how Strava shows activities.
  - Each session includes social engagement fields: `supportCount`, `commentCount`, and `isSupported`.
  - `getFeedSessions()` fetches sessions from the `sessions` collection and populates them with user and project data to create `SessionWithDetails`.
  - Profile tabs show user sessions as their activity history.
  - Support/comments are tied directly to session IDs.
  - All components use `SessionWithDetails` instead of `PostWithDetails`.
  - Comments use `sessionId` instead of `postId`.
  - All fields include proper fallbacks for missing data to prevent rendering errors.

### Required Firestore Indexes

The following composite indexes are required for the feed to work correctly:

1. **Sessions - Following Feed**
   - Collection: `sessions`
   - Fields: `visibility` (Ascending), `createdAt` (Descending)
   - Used for: Recent and Following feed types

2. **Sessions - Trending Feed**
   - Collection: `sessions`
   - Fields: `visibility` (Ascending), `createdAt` (Descending)
   - Used for: Trending posts in the last 7 days

Create these indexes in Firebase Console or they will be auto-suggested when you first load the feed.

## Contributing

This project follows a structured development approach with clear separation of concerns and TypeScript for type safety. When adding new features:

1. Define types in `src/types/`
2. Create components in `src/components/`
3. Add pages in `src/app/`
4. Follow the established design system
5. Write tests for new functionality

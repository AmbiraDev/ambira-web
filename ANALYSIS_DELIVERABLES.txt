SUCCESS CRITERIA
================================================================================

METRIC TARGETS (8-WEEK CYCLE):
- Growth: 2x DAU (2,000 → 4,000+)
- Retention: 50%+ D7 retention (up from 40%)
- Engagement: 3x sessions/user/week (2 → 6+)
- Quality: 40% test coverage (up from 11.74%)
- Adoption: 70%+ of users adopt new features within 30 days

KPI FRAMEWORK:
- Primary: DAU, D7 retention, avg sessions/week
- Secondary: Streak participation, leaderboard engagement, achievement unlock rate
- Quality: Test coverage, page load time, error rate

MEASUREMENT APPROACH:
- Daily: Firebase Analytics (DAU, session count)
- Weekly: Cohort analysis (D7 retention), feature adoption
- Monthly: Quarterly business reviews (OKRs, competitive moves)

================================================================================
RISK MITIGATION
================================================================================

KEY RISKS:
1. Strava enters productivity space (Medium probability, High impact)
   → Mitigation: Build product + community defensibility
   
2. Duolingo adds gamification to productivity (Low probability, High impact)
   → Mitigation: Differentiate on work-specific features (groups, challenges)
   
3. New entrant with better execution (High probability, High impact)
   → Mitigation: Move fast (100K users in 6 months), build community lock-in
   
4. Feature creep delays launches (High probability, Medium impact)
   → Mitigation: Strict scope control, cut features early

CONTINGENCY PLANS:
- If achievements don't drive engagement → Add social achievements
- If leaderboards create toxicity → Add "friends only" private leaderboards
- If PWA adoption slow → Focus on native iOS/Android apps instead

================================================================================

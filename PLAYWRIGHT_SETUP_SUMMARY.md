## 🎯 Smoke Test Coverage

### Feed Page (`/`)
- ✅ Page loads successfully
- ✅ Navigation elements visible
- ✅ No critical console errors
- ✅ WCAG 2.0/2.1 Level AA compliance
- ✅ Mobile responsiveness
- ✅ Keyboard navigation

### Timer Page (`/timer`)
- ✅ Timer interface loads
- ✅ Controls functional
- ✅ No critical console errors
- ✅ WCAG 2.0/2.1 Level AA compliance
- ✅ Mobile responsiveness
- ✅ Keyboard navigation
- ✅ Authentication handling

### Authentication
- ✅ Login page loads
- ✅ Form validation works
- ✅ No critical console errors
- ✅ WCAG 2.0/2.1 Level AA compliance
- ✅ Mobile responsiveness
- ✅ Keyboard navigation
- ✅ Protected routes handled

## 🚀 Available Commands

```bash
# Run all E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run only smoke tests
npm run test:smoke

# Run tests in UI mode (interactive)
npm run test:e2e:ui

# Run tests in debug mode
npm run test:e2e:debug

# View last test report
npm run test:e2e:report
```

## 🔄 CI/CD Integration

### When Tests Run
- ✅ Every pull request to main
- ✅ Every push to main branch
- ✅ Can be triggered manually

### What Happens in CI
1. Dependencies installed and cached
2. Playwright browsers installed and cached
3. Application built in production mode
4. Server started on localhost:3000
5. Smoke tests executed in Chromium
6. Reports uploaded on failure (screenshots, videos, traces)

### Performance
- Typical run time: 3-5 minutes (with cache)
- Tests run in parallel: No (for CI stability)
- Retries on failure: 2 attempts
- Browser: Chromium only (fastest)

## ♿ Accessibility Features

### What's Tested
- WCAG 2.0 Level A & AA
- WCAG 2.1 Level A & AA
- Color contrast ratios
- ARIA attributes
- Semantic HTML structure
- Keyboard navigation
- Screen reader compatibility

### Tools & Utilities
- **axe-core**: Automated scanning via `@axe-core/playwright`
- **Custom fixtures**: `makeAxeBuilder()` for easy accessibility testing
- **Helper functions**: `runAccessibilityScan()`, `formatA11yViolations()`
- **Basic checks**: `checkBasicAccessibility()` for manual validation

## 📊 Test Reports

### Local Development
```bash
# Generate and view HTML report
npm run test:e2e:report
```

### CI Environment
Reports uploaded as artifacts to GitHub Actions:
- HTML test report (`playwright-report/`)
- Test results (`test-results/`)
- Screenshots of failures
- Video recordings of failed tests
- Execution traces for debugging

## 🎓 Key Features

### 1. Accessibility-First
Every smoke test includes WCAG compliance checks using axe-core.

### 2. Mobile Testing
Tests run on both desktop (1440x900) and mobile (Pixel 5) viewports.

### 3. CI Optimized
- Browser caching
- Parallel job execution
- Artifact uploads only on failure
- Smart retries for flaky tests

### 4. Developer Experience
- UI mode for interactive testing
- Debug mode with step-through execution
- HTML reports with traces and videos
- Quick start guide for new developers

### 5. Comprehensive Documentation
- Quick start guide (5 minutes)
- Complete E2E testing guide
- CI/CD setup documentation
- Best practices and troubleshooting

## 📝 Next Steps

### Immediate
1. Install Playwright browsers locally:
   ```bash
   npx playwright install
   ```

2. Run smoke tests locally:
   ```bash
   npm run test:smoke
   ```

3. Review test reports:
   ```bash
   npm run test:e2e:report
   ```

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] Visual regression testing (screenshot comparison)
- [ ] Performance testing (Core Web Vitals)
- [ ] Cross-browser testing (Firefox, Safari)
- [ ] Authenticated test state (faster login tests)
- [ ] Parallel test execution in CI
- [ ] Automatic PR comments with test results

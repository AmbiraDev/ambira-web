## API Integration

### Firebase API Methods
All implemented in `src/lib/firebaseApi.ts`:

**Post Management:**
- `createPost(data)` - Create new post from session
- `getFeedPosts(limit, cursor, filters)` - Paginated feed
- `supportPost(postId)` - Add support to post
- `removeSupport(postId)` - Remove support
- `updatePost(postId, data)` - Edit post
- `deletePost(postId)` - Delete post
- `listenToPostUpdates(postIds, callback)` - Real-time updates
- `getUserPosts(userId, limit)` - Get user's posts

**Session & Post Integration:**
- `createSessionWithPost(sessionData, postContent, visibility)` - Combined creation

**Real-time Updates:**
- Firestore listeners for support counts
- Automatic UI updates when support changes
- Efficient batch processing

## Design Philosophy

### Strava-Inspired Elements
1. **Clean Card Design:** White cards with subtle shadows
2. **Stats Grid:** 2-column layout for key metrics
3. **Visual Hierarchy:** Clear separation of content sections
4. **Support System:** Heart-based engagement like Kudos
5. **Avatars:** Circular profile pictures with gradient fallbacks
6. **Color Accents:** Orange brand color for primary actions

### Brand Colors
- **Primary:** Orange (`from-orange-500 to-orange-600`)
- **Success:** Green for completed tasks
- **Neutral:** Grays for backgrounds and text
- **Interactive:** Blue for comments, Green for share

### Typography
- **Bold headlines** for user names and session titles
- **Medium weight** for stats and labels
- **Regular** for descriptions and body text
- **Small caps** for stat labels

## User Experience Features

### Optimistic Updates
- Support button responds immediately
- Background sync with rollback on error
- Smooth animations and transitions

### Loading States
- Skeleton screens for initial load
- Inline spinners for pagination
- Shimmer effects on placeholders

### Error Handling
- Graceful error messages
- Retry buttons
- Fallback content

### Accessibility
- Semantic HTML structure
- ARIA labels where needed
- Keyboard navigation support
- Focus indicators
- High contrast ratios

## Feed Algorithm

### Ranking Factors (Firebase Implementation)
Currently implemented as simple chronological feed with:
- Descending order by creation date
- Pagination with cursor-based loading
- 20 posts per page

**Future Enhancements:**
- Weight by follower engagement
- Time decay for older posts
- Promoted content from popular users
- Personalization based on interactions

## Mobile Responsiveness

### Breakpoints
- Desktop: 3-column layout (1024px+)
- Tablet: 2-column layout (768px - 1023px)
- Mobile: Single column (< 768px)

### Mobile Optimizations
- Larger touch targets (min 44px)
- Simplified navigation
- Bottom nav bar
- Stacked layouts
- Optimized images

## Performance Optimizations

### Code Splitting
- Lazy loading for modal components
- Dynamic imports for heavy features

### Data Management
- Cursor-based pagination
- Efficient Firestore queries
- Indexed fields for fast lookups
- Batch processing for multiple posts

### Caching Strategy
- React state for current view
- Firestore offline persistence
- Optimistic UI updates
- Stale-while-revalidate pattern

## Testing

### Unit Tests
- PostStats component: 11 tests ✅
- PostCard rendering
- PostInteractions behavior
- Feed loading and pagination

### Integration Tests
- Feed flow from session to post
- Support system end-to-end
- Real-time updates

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Comments System:** Nested threading, replies
2. **@Mentions:** Tag users in posts
3. **Image Uploads:** Attach photos to posts
4. **Post Editing:** Edit after publishing
5. **Saved Posts:** Bookmark functionality
6. **Notifications:** Real-time alerts for interactions
7. **Advanced Filtering:** Filter by project, tag, date
8. **Search:** Full-text post search
9. **Analytics:** Post performance metrics
10. **Sharing:** External social media sharing

### Performance Improvements
- Virtual scrolling for long feeds
- Image lazy loading
- Progressive image loading
- Service worker caching
